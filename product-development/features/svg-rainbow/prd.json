        "Each arc is a <path> element using an SVG arc command, with a stroke-width of 8px and no fill",
        "The outermost arc (red) has a radius of approximately 150px, with each inner arc decreasing by 10px",
        "The rainbow is horizontally centered on the page and placed below the main heading",
        "The SVG has a viewBox that properly frames all arcs without clipping",
        "The rainbow fades in on page load using a CSS opacity transition (0 to 1 over 1 second)",
        "The component has data-testid='rainbow-arc' on the SVG element for testability",
        "The SVG has role='img' and an aria-label of 'Decorative rainbow' for accessibility"
